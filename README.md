Required files include any of the tracking datasets from TrackingData Folder.
tracking_week_1.csv was the dataset used for this file, so downloading that file and updating the file path is required to run that code.
Otherwise updating the dataset and frameid will allow you to evaluate the space control model for any desired frame.
In addition, downloading the imports is also required.
